#The last exercises will all have to do with the files data1-4.gb, which are various Genbank 
#entries of genes. First you should study the files, notice the structure of the data. 
#In all exercises you will have to parse (read and find the wanted data) the files using 
#RE's which are very well designed for that purpose. Every exercise adds to the previous ones, 
#so the final program can do a lot. Remember. Your program should be able to handle all files, 
#but just one at a time.
