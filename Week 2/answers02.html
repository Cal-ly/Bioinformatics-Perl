<b>Exercise 1</b><br>
<pre>
print "Hello World\n";
</pre>
<hr>

<b>Exercise 2</b><br>
<pre>
$i = 1;
while ($i &lt;= 10) {
   print "Hello World\n";
   $i++;
}
</pre>
<hr>

<b>Exercise 3</b><br>
This simple exercise (and the one before) can be done in several correct,
but bad ways, which will be shown here.
<pre>
$i = 1;
while ($i &lt; 11) {
   print "$i\n";
   $i++;
}

$i = 0;
while ($i &lt; 10) {
   $i++;
   print "$i\n";
}

for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 10; $i++;) {
   print $i+1, "\n";
}
</pre>
The good ways.
<pre>
$i = 1;
while ($i &lt;= 10) {
   print "$i\n";
   $i++;
}

for ($i = 1; $i &lt;= 10; $i++;) {
   print "$i\n";
}
</pre>
What we want to do is to count from 1 to 10. By mentioning both numbers in
the code like in the last examples you document your intentions clearly,
making the code easier to read and understand for you, me and everybody else.
Maintenance becomes easier. This is a simple example of one of the principles
in writing good code.<br>
Another principle is in play: When you enter the loop then you have passed a
condition ($i &lt;= 10). That condition should be true all the way through the
body of the loop, where the work is being done (print in this case). In the end
of the body you change the counting variable thereby making ready for the next
round in the loop, testing in the condition if you should go another round.<br>
Following this makes for good solid code.

<b>Exercise 4</b><br>
There are several fine way to solve this. Here is a simple solution.
<pre>
print "Please enter your name: ";
$name = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $name;
print "Welcome to my world, $name\n";
if ($name eq 'Peter') {
   print "It is so good to see you again.\n";
}
</pre>
<hr>

<b>Exercise 5</b><br>
<pre>
print "Please enter a number: ";
$first = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $first;
print "Please enter another number: ";
$second = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $second;
$sum = $first + $second;
print "$first + $second = $sum\n";
</pre>
<hr>

<b>Exercise 6</b><br>
First I present a correct, but still insufficient solution, as
the error handling is non-existant.
<pre>
print "Please enter a number: ";
$first = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $first;
print "Please enter another number: ";
$second = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $second;
print "Please enter the operation you wish to perform (+,-,*,/): ";
$operation = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $operation;
if ($operation eq '+') {
   $result = $first + $second;
}
if ($operation eq '-') {
   $result = $first - $second;
}
if ($operation eq '*') {
   $result = $first * $second;
}
if ($operation eq '/') {
   $result = $first / $second;
}
print "$first $operation $second = $result\n";
</pre>
I have now introduced error handling. When programming you also need to
look for what can go wrong (requires good imagination), not just what
you need to achieve. The above solution would not react correctly if I
entered a wrong operator like %. Also if I choose to enter 0 as my second
number and / as the operator, I would produce a division-by-zero error.
Not really stellar programming :-)<br>
Generally, one should always consider if a division-by-zero error is possible
whenever division is used.
<pre>
print "Please enter a number: ";
$first = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $first;
print "Please enter another number: ";
$second = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $second;
print "Please enter the operation you wish to perform (+,-,*,/): ";
$operation = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $operation;
if ($operation eq '+') {
   $result = $first + $second;
} elsif ($operation eq '-') {
   $result = $first - $second;
} elsif ($operation eq '*') {
   $result = $first * $second;
} elsif ($operation eq '/') {
   if ($second == 0) {
      $result = 'Infinity (division by zero)'; 
   } else {
      $result = $first / $second;
   }
} else {
   print "Error, you did not enter a legal operation.\n";
   exit; # Having encountered an error, we stop executing.
         # This is not great or elegant, but better than continuing.
}
print "$first $operation $second = $result\n";
</pre>

<b>Exercise 7</b><br>
<pre>
print "Please enter a number: ";
$low = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $low;
print "Please enter another higher number: ";
$high = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $high;
$i = $low;
while ($i <= $high) {
   print "$i\n";
   $i++;
}
</pre>
<hr>

<b>Exercise 8</b><br>
A common solution, here you have two loops, one for the case where
the first number is higher than the second number, and one for the
opposite situation.
<pre>
print "Please enter a number: ";
$low = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $low;
print "Please enter another number: ";
$high = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $high;
if ($low &lt; $high) {
   for($i = $low; $i &lt;= $high; $i++) {
      print "$i\n";
   }
} else {
   for($i = $high; $i &lt;= $low; $i++) {
      print "$i\n";
   }
}
</pre>
When you deal with data/input that is chaotic/unsystematic in nature,
then a VERY good principle is to read the input first, then put it into some
kind of order/system/structure. After that is is much simpler to perform
whatever calculations you need to do, because you get rid of many of the
special cases and you know exactly how the data looks, because you have made
it that way yourself. When you have special cases then the code gets
complicated, harder to read and maintain.<br>
In this situation, all you have to do is put the numbers in the right order
(low first) if they are in the wrong order. Just to be clear; this is the
superior solution.
<pre>
print "Please enter a number: ";
$low = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $low;
print "Please enter another number: ";
$high = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $high;
if ($low &gt; $high) {
   $tmp = $low;
   $low = $high;
   $high = $tmp;
}
$i = $low;
while ($i &lt;= $high) {
   print "$i\n";
   $i++;
}
</pre>
<hr>
<b>Exercise 9</b><br>
A very condensed and optimized solution.
<pre>
# Get the initial number
print "Please, enter a number: ";
$number = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $number;
# Ask for new numbers repeatedly
$newnumber = $number;
while ($newnumber &gt;= $number) {
   $number = $newnumber;
   print "Enter another number: ";
   $newnumber = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
   chomp $newnumber;
}
print "You finally entered a number less than any previous number\n";
</pre>
The loop can be structured differently. The condition can be placed
in the end of the loop instead of the beginning. This can sometimes
be an advantage, but not really in this case.
<pre>
# Get the initial number
print "Please, enter a number: ";
$number = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $number;
# Ask for new numbers repeatedly
$newnumber = $number;
do {
   $number = $newnumber;
   print "Enter another number: ";
   $newnumber = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
   chomp $newnumber;
} while ($newnumber &gt;= $number);
print "You finally entered a number less than any previous number\n";
</pre>
<hr>
<b>Exercise 10</b><br>
Please note that according to the exercise, it is not required to handle 0.
<pre>
print "Please enter a positive integer: ";
$number = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $number;
if ($number &gt; 0) {
   $factorial = 1; # 1 is identity for multiplication
   $i = $number;
   while ($i &gt; 0) {
      $factorial *= $i;
      $i--;
   }
   print "Factorial ($number!) of $number is $factorial\n";
} else {
   print "You did not enter a positive integer, stupid\n";
}
</pre>
But it can be done painlessly anyway. It is also possible to optimize
one turn of the loop away, since you do not need to multiply by 1.<br>
Caution: By definition, 0! is 1. This should be known - at least if you try to
handle 0.
<pre>
print "Please enter a positive integer: ";
$number = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $number;
if ($number &gt;= 0) {
   $factorial = 1; # 1 is identity for multiplication
   for ($i = $number; $i &gt; 1; $i--) {
      $factorial *= $i;
   }
   print "Factorial ($number!) of $number is $factorial\n";
} else {
   print "You entered a negative integer, stupid\n";
}
</pre>
You can even check if the user enters letters instead of digits.
<pre>
print "Please enter a positive integer: ";
$number = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $number;
if ($number == 0 and $number ne '0') {
   print "Only numbers allowed\n";
} elsif ($number &gt;= 0) {
   $factorial = 1; # 1 is identity for multiplication
   for ($i = $number; $i &gt; 1; $i--) {
      $factorial *= $i;
   }
   print "Factorial ($number!) of $number is $factorial\n";
} else {
   print "You entered a negative integer, stupid\n";
}
</pre>

<b>Exercise 11</b><br>
The naive approach is to split it up in two cases.
<pre>
print "Please enter an integer: ";
$number = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $number;
$sum = 0;
if ($number &gt;= 0) {
   for ($i = 1; $i &lt;= $number; $i++) {
      $sum += $i;
   }
} else {
   for ($i = $number; $i &lt; 0; $i++) {
      $sum += $i;
   }
}
print "The summing of $sign$number to 0 is $sign$sum\n";
</pre>
The guiding principle should be not to make special cases out of everything,
but rather make generalized code. First have a bit of code in the beginning
that systemizes everything, and once you have a system in your data, make 
the computational part. Similar to 8.
<pre>
print "Please enter an integer: ";
$number = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $number;
$sign = '';
if ($number &lt; 0) {
   $sign = '-';
   $number = -$number;
}
$i = $number;
$sum = 0; # 0 is identity for addition
while ($i &gt; 0) {
   $sum += $i;
   $i--;
}
print "The summing of $sign$number to 0 is $sign$sum\n";
</pre>
A different, but equally good way to handle the problem is this.
<pre>
print "Please enter an integer: ";
$number = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $number;
if ($number &lt; 0) {
   $high = -1;
   $low = $number;
} else {
   $high = $number;
   $low = 1;
}
$sum = 0; # 0 is identity for addition
for ($i = $low; $i &lt;= $high; $i++) {
   $sum += $i;
}
print "The summing of $number to 0 is $sum\n";
</pre>
A rather elegant solution. There is no performance loss; the
<b>if</b> in other solutions is replaced with a failed loop.
<pre>
print "Please enter an integer: ";
$number = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $number;
$sum = 0; # 0 is identity for addition
for ($i = $number; $i &gt; 0; $i--) {
   $sum += $i;
}
for ($i = $number; $i &lt; 0; $i++) {
   $sum += $i;
}
print "The summing of $number to 0 is $sum\n";
</pre>
Letting the sign of the number decide which way to count.
<pre>
print "Please enter an integer: ";
$number = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $number;
$sum = 0; # 0 is identity for addition
$step = $number &lt; 0 ? 1 : -1;
for ($i = $number; $i != 0; $i += $step) {
   $sum += $i;
}
print "The summing of $number to 0 is $sum\n";
</pre>
Because this is an arithmetic progression one could use the formula.
That is so smart that it is almost cheating.
<pre>
print "Please enter an integer: ";
$no = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
chomp $no;
$sum = $no &lt; 0 ? -$no*($no-1)/2 : $no*($no+1)/2;
print "The summing of $no to 0 is $sum\n";
</pre>
