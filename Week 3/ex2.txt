So I have to feed my average program 'ex1.pl' with the input file
'ex2input.txt'. to do so, I simply type the following in the prombt

perl ex1.pl <ex2input.txt

If I wanted the result saved to a file I just redirect the output to a new file

perl ex1.pl <ex2input.txt >res.txt

Notice that both files are in the same folder, and so will the newly created
file 'res.txt' also be saved to. The output will also contain all the text
that are written on screen.
